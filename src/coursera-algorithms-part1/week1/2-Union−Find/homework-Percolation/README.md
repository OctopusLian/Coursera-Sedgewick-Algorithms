Specification
Here is the programming assignment specification that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.

Web Submission
Submit a zip file named percolation.zip that contains only the two source files Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java. 

Assessment Report
Here is some information to help you interpret the assessment report. See the Assessment Guide for more details.

Compilation: we compile your .java files using a Java 8 compiler. Any error or warning messages are displayed and usually signify a major defect in your code. If your program does not compile, no further tests are performed.
API: we check that your code exactly matches the prescribed API (no extra methods and no missing methods). If it does not, no further tests are performed.
Bugs: we run SpotBugs to check for common bug patterns in Java programs. A warning message strongly suggests a bug in your code but occasionally there are false positives. Here is a summary of bug descriptions, which you can use to help decode warning messages.
Style: we run Checkstyle to automatically checks the style of your Java programs. Here is a list of available Checkstyle checks, which you can use to help decode any warning messages.
Correctness: we perform a battery of unit tests to check that your code meets the specifications. 
Memory: we determine the amount of memory according to the 64-bit memory cost model from lecture. 
Timing: we measure the running time and count the number of elementary operations.
Personalized Feedback
In addition to the autograder feedback (available for free via Coursera platform), you can pay to have a teaching assistant read and provide personalized feedback on your submission at https://mooc.codepost.io.
