## Homework Hello World  

```
Under Construction (2021-01-24)
When available, this assignment will be optional. Its sole purpose is to ensure that you can write simple Java programs, use algs4.jar, and submit the assignment.

Specification
Here is the programming assignment specification (under construction) that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.

Web Submission
Submit a zip file named hello.zip that contains only the two source files HelloWorld.java and HelloGoodbye.java.
